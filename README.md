# SP0256A Library

This library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling the SP0256A speech synthesis module with Arduino-compatible boards, including the ESP32 and ESP8266.

The SP0256A is a vintage speech synthesis chip that can generate human-like speech by playing back a sequence of allophones. This library simplifies the process of sending allophone codes to the SP0256A, allowing you to easily add speech capabilities to your projects.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for controlling the SP0256A module
- Support for speaking numbers from 0 to 9
- Compatible with various Arduino-compatible boards, including ESP32 and ESP8266

## Installation

1. Download the library as a ZIP file.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library, and select the downloaded ZIP file.
3. The SP0256A library should now be available in the Arduino IDE under Sketch > Include Library.

## Usage

1. Include the SP0256A library at the beginning of your sketch:

```cpp
#include "SP0256A.h"

    Define the pin connections for the SP0256A module:

cpp

#define ALD_PIN 5
#define LRQ_PIN 4
#define RESET_PIN 2

    Create an SP0256A object with the defined pin connections:

cpp

SP0256A sp0256a(ALD_PIN, LRQ_PIN, RESET_PIN);

    In the setup() function, initialize the SP0256A module:

cpp

sp0256a.begin();

    In the loop() function, use the speakNumber() function to make the SP0256A module speak a number:

cpp

int numberToSpeak = 5; // Change this to the number you want to speak
sp0256a.speakNumber(numberToSpeak);
delay(3000); // Wait for 3 seconds before speaking the number again
