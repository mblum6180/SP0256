# SP0256A Library

This library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling the SP0256A speech synthesis module with Arduino-compatible boards, including the ESP32 and ESP8266.

The SP0256A is a vintage speech synthesis chip that can generate human-like speech by playing back a sequence of allophones. This library simplifies the process of sending allophone codes to the SP0256A, allowing you to easily add speech capabilities to your projects.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for controlling the SP0256A module
- Support for speaking numbers from 0 to 9
- Compatible with various Arduino-compatible boards, including ESP32 and ESP8266

## Installation

1. Download the library as a ZIP file.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library, and select the downloaded ZIP file.
3. The SP0256A library should now be available in the Arduino IDE under Sketch > Include Library.

## Usage

1. Include the SP0256A library at the beginning of your sketch:

```cpp
#include "SP0256A.h"

    Define the pin connections for the SP0256A module:

cpp

#define ALD_PIN 5
#define LRQ_PIN 4
#define RESET_PIN 2

    Create an SP0256A object with the defined pin connections:

cpp

SP0256A sp0256a(ALD_PIN, LRQ_PIN, RESET_PIN);

    Connect address lines A0-A7 on the SP0256A chip to 8 GPIO pins on the ESP32, for example, GPIO13-GPIO20. These pins will be used for sending allophone data to the chip.

    Connect the ALD (Address Load) pin on the SP0256A chip to another GPIO pin on the ESP32, for example, GPIO5. This pin will be used to signal the chip when the data is ready to be loaded.

    Connect the LRQ (Load Request) pin on the SP0256A chip to another GPIO pin on the ESP32, for example, GPIO4. This pin will be used to check if the SP0256A chip is ready to receive new data.

    Connect the RESET pin on the SP0256A chip to another GPIO pin on the ESP32, for example, GPIO2. This pin will be used to reset the chip.

    Connect the GND (Ground) pin on the SP0256A chip to a GND pin on the ESP32.

    Connect the VCC (Power) pin on the SP0256A chip to a 5V pin on the ESP32. As mentioned earlier, the SP0256A chip requires a 5V power supply, so you may need to use a level shifter or voltage divider between the ESP32's GPIO pins and the ALD, LRQ, RESET, and address lines on the SP0256A chip.

    Connect an amplifier and speaker to the AUDIO OUT pin of the SP0256A chip to hear the generated speech.


    In the setup() function, initialize the SP0256A module:

cpp

sp0256a.begin();

    In the loop() function, use the speakNumber() function to make the SP0256A module speak a number:

cpp

int numberToSpeak = 5; // Change this to the number you want to speak
sp0256a.speakNumber(numberToSpeak);
delay(3000); // Wait for 3 seconds before speaking the number again
